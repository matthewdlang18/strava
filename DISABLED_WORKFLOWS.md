# Disabled Deployment Workflows

The following GitHub Actions workflows have been disabled in favor of the streamlined GitHub Pages deployment:

## Currently Disabled Workflows

### 1. deploy-simple.yml.disabled
- **Purpose**: Multi-platform deployment to Render, Railway, and Heroku
- **Features**: Docker container builds, external service deployments
- **Disabled**: 2024 - Replaced with GitHub Pages for simpler static site deployment

### 2. deploy.yml.disabled
- **Purpose**: Main deployment workflow with multiple environments
- **Features**: Complex deployment pipeline with multiple stages
- **Disabled**: 2024 - Simplified to focus on GitHub Pages only

### 3. deploy-render-only.yml.disabled
- **Purpose**: Render-only deployment workflow
- **Features**: Backend + frontend deployment to Render platform
- **Disabled**: 2024 - Eliminated external dependencies

### 4. deploy-multi-platform.yml.disabled
- **Purpose**: Deploy to multiple cloud platforms simultaneously
- **Features**: Parallel deployments to various hosting services
- **Disabled**: 2024 - Streamlined to single deployment target

## Active Workflow

### github-pages.yml ✅
- **Purpose**: Deploy React app to GitHub Pages as static site
- **Features**: 
  - Builds React frontend with demo mode
  - Uses localStorage instead of external database
  - Automatic deployment on push to main branch
  - Manual deployment via workflow_dispatch

## Why GitHub Pages Only?

1. **Simplicity**: No external service dependencies or API keys needed
2. **Reliability**: GitHub's infrastructure ensures consistent uptime
3. **Cost**: Completely free hosting for public repositories
4. **Performance**: Static site loads faster than full-stack applications
5. **Maintenance**: No backend servers or databases to maintain

## Re-enabling External Deployments

If you need to re-enable external deployments in the future:

1. Remove the `.disabled` extension from the desired workflow file
2. Update the workflow with current action versions
3. Configure required secrets in repository settings
4. Test the deployment in a separate branch first

## Current Architecture

```
Frontend (React) → localStorage → GitHub Pages
```

**Previous Architecture** (now disabled):
```
Frontend (React) → FastAPI Backend → MongoDB → External Hosting
```
