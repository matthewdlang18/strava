## 🎯 What You Need to Do

### 🚨 Good News: Heroku Errors Fixed!
The previous Heroku deployment errors you saw were **intentional** - the workflow was designed to skip platforms without proper secrets. I've now simplified the workflow to focus only on **Render** (the recommended platform), so no more confusing error messages!

### 1. Quick Deployment (Recommended)
Follow the **QUICK_START.md** guide for fastest deployment:
1. Get Strava API credentials (5 minutes)
2. Set up MongoDB Atlas (5 minutes)
3. Deploy to Render (15 minutes)
4. Test your app (5 minutes)

### 2. Local Development Setup
Run the setup script for local development:
```bash
./setup.sh
```
